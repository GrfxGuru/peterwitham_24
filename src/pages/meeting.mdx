Please find below a calendar that you can use to book some of my time. I often use this to schedule guests for my podcasts and discussions. This should not be used for cold outreach. For that, I recommend my Contact form.

Please fill in all fields, including a description. If you are scheduling as a Podcast guest and we have already spoken, you can just put "Podcast recording."

Many thanks for reaching out to me.
