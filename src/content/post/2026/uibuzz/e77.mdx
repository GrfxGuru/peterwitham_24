I'm pivoting my hacking game Project Hack from Unity to web technologies—React, TypeScript, and Vite.

This shift lets players write JavaScript scripts to hack in-game, using the Monaco editor and a custom terminal. I'm building for desktop with Tauri and adding D3.js for network visualizations.

The game now supports multiple playstyles: click-based or code-based hacking. It's live on itch.io in early development. This approach eliminates engine constraints and accelerates feature development.
