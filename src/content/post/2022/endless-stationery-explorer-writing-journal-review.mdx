This is my review of the Endless Stationary Explorer writing journal with Regalia paper.

Analog writing always wins for me. Something about the tactile response of pen and paper combined with the slower process of handwriting makes the experience more wholesome and rewarding.

You might think any paper, pencil, or pen will do just fine. But that's not the case, at least for me. That would be like saying that any camera, computer, vehicle, coffee, tea, or sandwich will do. You get my point.

To enjoy something, you have to find things that make the experience enjoyable and make you want to engage with them. In this case, it is finding the right paper that does not bleed, whether I'm using a fountain pen (again, back to the tools that make something pleasurable), pencil, or any pen.

That is where the 80gsm Regalia paper from [Endless Stationery](https://www.madebyendless.com/) comes in. I have used more types of notebooks than I can remember. The most prolonged standing for me is from two companies up until now.

- [Moleskine notebooks](https://www.moleskine.com/)

- [FieldNotes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/)

Not to take away anything from these two companies' products, they are prevalent, and I have used them for many years, but the paper in their books does not play well with many inks and has terrible bleed-through. This leads to slightly smudgy text and sometimes makes it impossible for me to use both sides of the page, especially regarding the thin Moleskine paper.

There is a special mention here for FieldNotes, who come up with unique cover designs. I have collections that I'll never use to admire the covers.

On the other hand, Regalia has been able to handle anything I have used on it, including many different types of fountain pen inks that can be notorious for bleeding.

## The Packaging

First, look at the photo in this post. The packaging it comes in is terrific. Opening the box, you are presented with a welcoming color of Gold on Black in a rigid container that protects the contents and serves as storage for your notebooks as you fill them up. A brilliant idea!

In the box, you get everything you see in the photograph, minus the pen. So that means,

- Your leather cover of choice

- Two storyboard notebooks

- A matching pen holder that also serves as a way to keep the journal closed

Each item is carefully and thoughtfully wrapped in tissue paper to protect them during transport.

## The Contents

### The Cover

I went with a Green leather cover. The closest way I can describe the shade of Green is a slightly darker British racing Green. I am happy with this as it is not too bright and hopefully will not show scuff and scratch marks as it grows older over time from use.

By default, three bands along the spine enable you to add up to three notebooks. Another nice touch is they stay out of the way should you decide only to use one or two of them.

It is fair and only proper to mention that, like many leather-based products, there is a slight odor the first couple of days that fades fast.

There is also another looped band in the spine that you can use to secure the cover. The one thing to note is that if you choose not to use it, it will just hang off the body, which could snag on something or be annoying. I like to keep my journals closed, so this will be used constantly and not be a problem.

Overall, this will protect my notebooks and continue to look nice as they age and suffer from use.

### The Storyboard notebook

Each storyboard notebook has sixty-four pages of dotted Regalia 80gsm paper. As I previously mentioned, this paper is excellent at holding any ink I have put on it without bleeding and feels good. Not too stiff and not too thin, it is a delight to write and draw on. The weight is also suitable for gluing onto without concern of wrinkling.

You get two notebooks in the box. I have since ordered another three refills. That is how impressed I am.

I'd also like to note that shipping is fast. We are talking days, not weeks!

## My Final Thoughts

If you have read this far, it will be no surprise that I am delighted by this purchase and will have many beautiful hours writing in the Explorer from Endless Stationery.

I have found the missing link in my search for the right paper that does not require me to think ahead and carry the right pen. As a left-handed writer, my writing is not the cleanest, and the more help I can get from the paper, the better my notes will be.

I want to add that Endless Stationery had no connection to this review, and I purchased everything out of my pocket for those concerned about influence in the review.
