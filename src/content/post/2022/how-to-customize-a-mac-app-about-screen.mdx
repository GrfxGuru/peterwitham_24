Mac app about screens are there by default when creating an application, but how can you customize them?

This video answers the question posed by one of my wonderful YouTube viewers.

Credit should also go to [CocoaType](https://twitch.tv/cocoatype), who brought to my attention a technique I was unaware of. My live-stream chatroom folks rock!

If you have ever used a Mac app, you may have noticed an 'About' option on the menu. This usually provides details on the application, like the version number.

When you create a Mac app, this is made for you by default. However, there are many times you might want to customize the content or the way it looks.

This video shows you exactly how to do that with two solutions.

One works using a text file and is available for both AppKit and SwiftUI apps.

The other is to create a complete replacement view for the 'About' button.
