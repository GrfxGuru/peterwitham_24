Yep, it's here, 2023. So what's the plan? Well, Great question. I don't know the answers, but I have some ideas for my 2023 planning.

I have a few things I want to get done this year, but not many details yet. Maybe that's the best way to start.

Create at least one new app. I am exploring the idea of taking some of my self-serving desktop and mobile apps and making them user-friendly enough to share with the world.

Make at least 100 good photo images. Note that I didn't say 100 images. They have to be winners, which is not as easy as you think.

To avoid procrastination, I will continue to post to my SmugMug account (you know you can buy my images, right?) and here, at least for the start of the year.

Make at least 50 good lengthy blog posts. Time to dive into the list of ideas again that I always keep floating around and get fingers to keys.

As always, expect plenty of programming and more photography posts going forward.
I mentioned previously that I'm also trying analog journaling. I want to make it consistent throughout the year so that book will always be close by.

I also want to revisit how my Podcasts are going and see what I can do to improve them, not only in the quality of content but also followers. I'm missing the mark somewhere on them and can do better.

So that's enough to get me started with 2023 planning. I am sure there will be more additions along the way, but I wanted to get a set of expectations in place to kick myself into gear and start making it happen.

What are you thinking of taking on? Let me know in the comments, and let me help mentor you along the way if I can to stay motivated and get them done.
