Content migration was my focus this week and a couple of other interesting topics.

First, let's dive into OpenAI and their changing approach towards allowing smaller teams and apps to use their chatGPT services. They seem to be tightening restrictions on apps that wrap around chat and GPT.

While I understand their perspective, I wonder if they anticipated this outcome. It's common for new technologies to attract a wave of apps that build upon them.

However, I can see the reasoning behind OpenAI's decision. Using their tools directly, without relying on wrapper apps, makes sense. It may burden their systems, but it also ensures that developers pay for the service they use.

Perhaps a solution lies in giving app developers the option to use their API, where they have paid to use chat and GPT. This would remove the burden from the developers and provide OpenAI with compensation. It's a win-win situation.

This change in OpenAI's approach reminds me of similar situations with other platforms and APIs, like Twitter. Ultimately, it will be interesting to see how this plays out. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic, so feel free to contact me on Twitter @UIBuzz or visit UIBuzz.com.

I've been working on the Christmas event for my game, Endless Hurdles, using SpriteKit. It's been a while since I've worked with Sprite Kit, but I'm pleased to say that my planning has paid off.

The Halloween event served as a solid foundation for future expansions. However, working with SpriteKit can be a bit of a pain sometimes. It makes me think about other game engines like Godot, Unreal, and Unity, which I've also been exploring.

Many people ask me which game engine I'm going with, and for now, it's SpriteKit. I plan to continue building with it until the end of the year and then reflect on the best way forward.

It's essential to have the flexibility to evaluate different options.

Lastly, I want to share my adventures in web development. I'm gradually moving away from WordPress and have built my new site with Astro.

However, transitioning the content is proving to be a challenge. Before migrating the content, I'm streamlining it by removing irrelevant posts. This step is crucial in saving time and effort.

Additionally, I'm still working on the content in WordPress, optimizing it for SEO purposes. It's a tedious task, but I'm already seeing positive results. Despite eventually moving away from WordPress, the effort put into improving the content is not wasted.

I highly recommend listening to my episodes on this topic if you are facing a similar situation. It's essential to consider the value and relevance of each piece of content before migrating it.

I'm open to discussing these topics further with anyone interested in coming on the podcast.
Just head over to PeterWitham.com/contact and let me know your thoughts.

I'm preparing for several interviews, some appearing on the CompileSwift podcast and others on UIBuzz.
