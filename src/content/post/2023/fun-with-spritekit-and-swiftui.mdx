title: Fun with SpriteKit and SwiftUI
excerpt: Doing development just for the fun of it is a great reward. That is where my SpriteKit and SwiftUI art generator project comes in.

On a recent live stream (see video below), I brought back an app I had been playing around with to generate images using SpriteKit with a SwiftUI interface.

While I did not achieve all my goals during the stream, I had a revelation the next day that pushed me further than branch replication. I also have animation working in a limited capacity.

Sometimes, you never know when inspiration will strike to help solve a problem and motivate you to progress on a project. This app has much more work to do, but it sure is fun.

A teaser shot from the following day's development.
