This was a massive week for updates and changes in my idle game. I will try to capture all the important things from my notes in this post, so [grab a coffee on me](https://peterwitham.com/coffee) and let's get started.

### Onboarding Screens

It was time to create the first attempt at the onboarding process to help new players understand what they are seeing and how to use the interface to make progress in the game. For this first pass, I have kept it simple with four screens that break down the key areas of the interface.

### Redesigned recent events log

After experimenting, I moved the random event log onto the main game screen. This makes more sense, I think, based on feedback from testers.

### Tooltips

Lots of tooltips on items when you hover over them, either with your finger or the cursor. They help explain what each part of the interface means and why you might want to consider using them during gameplay.

### Boss Fights

This is the first version with active boss fights. There are five bosses, each requiring a more demanding hacking power level. The rewards are worth the fight, but the loss is not. Choose battles wisely. I have 25 planned bosses, so you will have plenty to explore.

I have designed the system to make it easy for me to add new bosses. This was a long hard effort, but well worth the coding to make the future expansion easier.
