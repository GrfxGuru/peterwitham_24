OK, the pun is unintentional but maybe accurate. The Apple developer conference [WWDC23](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/) has given us a clear path of how Apple sees things going forward concerning Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality.

Namely, augmented is their plan, which makes more sense. It is easier for users to embrace the familiar while learning new paradigms as we advance.

Think about it. We went from button phones to touch screens. Keyboards to voice control. And now, desktop to augmented reality.

In my opinion, this stands a better chance of adoption beyond gaming than virtual reality does.

The problem with virtual reality is that you have to create everything. Augment means making the parts you need and letting reality do the rest.

Now this does not mean I believe the Apple headset will succeed or fail, this is just my take on how Apple sees that future playing out, and I think it makes a lot of sense.
