As Apple platforms unify the user experience and underlying technologies, we must change our approach to making apps.

Instead of designing for iOS and then expanding to macOS later. We must think about universal design and experience in our applications and then adapt it as required for each platform while retaining as much core design and idea as possible on all platforms.

Not only does this give a more natural feel to the user when they move from platform to platform, but it also enables us to think about feature parity. If we have the features on every platform, we can give more thought to the UI's implementation if needed for a particular part as appropriate.

We are seeing applications running on various platforms in ways we had not imagined until now. For example, iOS applications are running on Macs with the new [Apple silicon](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/). We have to adapt our thinking and planning to allow for the possibility that our applications operate in ways we had not anticipated. Spending more time ensuring our interfaces work nicely beyond our intended device or audience will enhance the experience.

There is another aspect that will become more important as we move forward.

For data syncing, users will expect that if an application exists on multiple platforms or devices, they should see their data or files on all those devices. For example, writing applications should make documents available for the user whenever they want to continue working.

When I evaluate an application used to create content of any kind, one of the primary things I check is to see if I can work on multiple devices. Depending on the need in an ideal situation, I want to work on my iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even Windows.

At the very least, I expect to use my Mac and iPad as primary work drivers when blogging or creating podcasts, for example.

Consider these thoughts when you create a new project or consider adding to an existing one. Your users will thank you for it.
