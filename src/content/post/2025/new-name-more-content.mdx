Some of you may have noticed a slight name change.

I decided to rename the Compile Swift Podcast to App Developer Podcast to recognize the trend of needing more technologies to make apps beyond just the Swift language.

Now don't worry. The content will still be the same as ever, but you will find more expansion to embrace the wider app development ecosystem.

This also enables me to bring in topics that until now have either existed in other Content or I have not shared with you all at all.

For example, game development. Something I enjoy that requires many different skills and technologies.

Now we can talk about these and more, and if the topic does not interest you, just skip the episode.

There will always be Swift discussion and development as it's my preferred language and therefore lives in my heart.

So if you are new to the Podcast, or want to dive into the archives head over to the [App Developer Page](/podcastcs) to find something to listen to.
