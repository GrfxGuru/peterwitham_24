I spent some time really trying to think this one through and find a working model I can use that gives me the boss information for the game UI and the fights. Currently the details look like this

### The code

``` c#
[0] = ("Male_17_0","Colin Optional",
    "He once opened the terminal and changed directory. Thinks he is a hacker!",
    new LargeNumber(10, 0),
    (ResourceTypes.Newbies, new LargeNumber(100, 0)),
    (ResourceTypes.Desktops, new LargeNumber(5, 0)),
    (ResourceTypes.Level2Access, new LargeNumber(2, 0))),
```

### So what is all this?

This gives me all the items I need in one dictionary entry making use of optionals to go beyond a key value pair.

- A reference to the sprite for the avatar
- A text description for the boss
- The Hacker Power of the boss (10 in this case)
- 3 reward items for defeating the boss, each contains the type and the quantity.

When it comes to adding a new boss all I need to do is add a new dictionary item and recompile. Nice and clean with a very quick way to iterate over the game.
