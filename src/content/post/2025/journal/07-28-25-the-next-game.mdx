I shipped Drop Saw. Which really needs a write up at some point, but the short version is I made and shipped it in about a month and a half as a challenge to myself.

Which means the next one enters the starting blocks.

However, this one is more of an evolution than anything. I have always planned to make a 3D version of Endless Hurdles because it not only makes a lot of sense for the game style, but I always intended for it to exist.

I have decided to use Unity to take advantage of being able to hopefully build it quickly and take advantage of not only my skills but assets that I already own to help build out 'the world' for it.

Below is the first development screenshot showing the random level generator and how it looks right now. I'm focusing more on the tech side to build the generator that I can use as the base for other levels just like I have with the 2D versions.
