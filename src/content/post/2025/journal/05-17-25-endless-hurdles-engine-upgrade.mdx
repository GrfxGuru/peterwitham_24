When I wrote the new build of Endless Hurdles using Godot. I used version 4.2.

Before I started work on the next series of features and updates to the game I decided it was time to get with the modern times and update to the latest Godot which is version 4.4 as of this post.

Thankfully, there was very little that needed changing.

The biggest change was to variable and function types that needed to go from floats to vector2 for gravity and other physics calculations. I decided this was something AI could help me with, so ChatGPT and I sat down to figure out how we would make changing the types without affecting functionality and having weirdness.

I'm happy to report, we made it through without incident. A few new numbers later and everything appears to be running fine and nobody is flying off in to the sky or crashing to the ground with the weight of a thousand suns.

Now, on to the new features including a new level with new mechanics to offer different ways to have fun.

The take-away here, never wait too long to upgrade that code base. Don't let it get so out of date that you end up with a mess and a headache.
