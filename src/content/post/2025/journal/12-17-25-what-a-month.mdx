The last month has been a whirlwind of activity. I have worked on just about everything from apps to games to podcasts to live streams.

Yeah, exhausting in the best possible way.

## Highlights

- **Project Hack Bosses**: Developed new bosses and massive game balancing for my [Project Hack game](https://projecthack.net).
- **Podcast Episodes**: Recorded and released new episodes of the [PW Podcast](https://pwpodcast.transistor.fm) and [UIBuzz](https://uibuzz.transistor.fm).
- **Live Streams**: Hosted multiple live streams covering various topics from first game play throughs, app and game development.

I cannot think of a better way to head towards the end of the year than pushing a bunch of new things out the door ready to chill for the holidays.

Although it won't be complete chill, there will still new live streams and podcast episodes.

Not to mention I'm already trying to plan for next year with my wish list of things to do with my apps and games.

The biggest push over the holiday period will be trying to make significant progress on my [Project Hack game](https://projecthack.net) so I an work towards some kind of first public full release. Which also means I need to seriously talk to myself about the possibility of releasing my first Steam game.

Something that truly excites and terrifies me at the same time.

So yeah, the month is not over and already so much has been done. To those needing motivation, I hope this post has given you some inspiration to keep pushing forward.

Remember, any progress is progress!
