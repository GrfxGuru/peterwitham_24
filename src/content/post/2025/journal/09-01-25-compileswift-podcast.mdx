I started the [Compile Swift Podcast](https://compileswift.transistor.fm) in 2019 with the goal of providing a resource for Swift developers. Over the years, I covered a wide range of topics, from the basics of Swift and SwiftUI to advanced techniques and best practices. I also had some great guest speakers.

Things really lifted off when I brought in a co-host. People loved the conversation and differing viewpoints. Something I also looked forward to every episode.

Here we are 193 episodes and some 131,382 (as of this post) downloads later. To say it exceeded my expectations was an understatement. The podcast has been a huge success, and I'm proud of what I accomplished not only from a content but also a technical perspective. I learned a lot about audio production and podcasting, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to share my knowledge with others.

I am grateful for the community that embraced and shared the podcast. I am especially grateful to the guests and the Patreon supporters that helped keep the project going.

Sadly, you may have noticed that over the past couple of months it has been a struggle to keep the schedule up. Partly due to workload and life commitments, but mostly due to the fact that I was struggling to find content worthy of the audience and their time.

Rather than continue to create episodes that I felt were not up to the standards set, I decided it was time to call it and end with a final episode rather than just disappear.

Make no mistake, my love of the Swift platform continues, I'm eagerly working towards releasing my new app.

For that matter, my love of Podcast making is as strong as ever and I want to find projects that I can embrace and continue to work on, be it solo or with other people. I also love appearing as a guest on other podcasts, so keep that in mind.

I have some ideas for some new shows, and the [PW Podcast](https://pwpodcast.transistor.fm) will be my main podcasting attention for now which allows me the freedom to explore any and all topics that interest me rather than specific niche topics. You may well find me talking Swift at times on the PW Podcast as app development continues to be my day and night job.
