Xcode 26, announced during Apple's WWDC25 now has integration with AI services beyond Apple's own services. In particular they highlighted ChatGPT.

Let's make it clear right now, that is not the only option. You can actually add any service via an API and credentials. Something that will appeal to many. I particularly like Claude but that is just a personal preference.

You can also add local models using the same method, something that will appeal to folks behind company firewalls.

I should also mention that you need to be running macOS 26 Tahoe to use the new feature, it will not work on earlier releases.

## Early impressions

My initial impressions using it along with the developer videos is it works as you would expect. If you have used any AI features in other editors like Cursor or JetBrains tools then you will already be familiar with how to get the most from the service.

It will work with open files and projects, using the project code base as context should you allow it to do so. Indeed, to get the most from it you really need to go that path.

For now, if you are an Xcode user and embracing the new tools, I think you will be happy with this over the experiences so far within Xcode.

## But what about the cost?
If you are using your own API key for a service then you already know how this works and what you are getting for free or paid.

As far as ChatGPT, you get a certain amount of requests daily for free (number unknown as of this post) and those reset. After that you have to pay, a familiar business model across services at this time and no surprises here.

If Apple would cover the cost and you get unlimited for free then they really would have sealed the deal here for many I feel and beaten some of the other tools to the finish line. I look forward to learning more details on the free vs cost going forward.
