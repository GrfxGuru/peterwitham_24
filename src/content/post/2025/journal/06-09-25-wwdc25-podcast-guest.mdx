As Apple WWDC25 kicks in to full steam on June 10th, I have the honor of appearing on two Podcasts discussing the conference and announcements. With more to come later in the week, no spoilers sorry :)

[Listen to Empower Apps episode](https://www.empowerapps.show/199)
<br/>[Listen to MTJC episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/more-than-just-code-podcast-ios-and-swift-development/id906987516?i=1000711951545)

Great conversations, I'm looking forward to recording more episodes with folks later in the week as we start working through all the new cool announcements for both consumers and developers.

As always, don't forget my own show, [Compile Swift](https://compileswift.com/podcast).
