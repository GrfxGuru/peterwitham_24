If you have read, listened, or watched, anything I do. You will be more than aware that I love productivity hacking, it is in my DNA and it keeps me on track for getting done all the things I need to stay on top of. Both personally and professionally.

But, it is all too easy to allow this to get in the way of making something fun or enjoyable. I think there is a valuable and valid argument for just going with the flow and saying to hell with planning, rules and process.

Do you remember the last time you said "I am just going to do -insert choice here- and not spend a lot of time thinking or planning it first"?

For me, it's been more than a while.

If it helps, think back to our childhood when we would just walk out the front door in the summer, disappear for hours on end without a care for what we are going to do or how to survive it (kids are way too safe these days b.t.w.).

While you are at it, allow those same care free ideas and thoughts to revisit you and maybe hang out for a little while.

These days we have enough things to worry about as we grow older and the World apparently grows more unpredicatable that we waste minutes planning every minute.

It's OK to have random time and random things, let's give it a go every now and then.
