Whilst I am super busy trying to finish my new application, I decided to take a break and explore the capabilities of Claude Code. I asked Claude to generate a web site for my app, and it did an amazing job! It even included a beautiful design and a responsive layout that worked perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.

So how did I do it? I asked Claude code to take a look at the source code for my application and generate a static Web site highlighting the features along with a contact form and a privacy policy.

I also said to use the color palette from my app's design system.

It generated very straight forward HTML and CSS (yep nothing fancy needed). So it loads fast and is compatible with browsers and devices, perfect for getting the biggest audience without issues.

Now I bet you want to see the results, well...you will just have to wait a very short amount of time while I get everything in place for the app so you can truly appreciate not only the site but try the App!
