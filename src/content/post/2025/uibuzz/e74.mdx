I’m particularly excited to talk about the progress and challenges in my ongoing project, "Project Hack", and some other tidbits from my development world.

### Progress on Project Hack

Over the past few months, amid endless cups of coffee and relentless late nights, I've been working tirelessly on my latest game, Project Hack. You can check it out at [ProjectHack.net](https://projecthack.net). There’s been a ton of development on this game, especially in terms of quality of life improvements. I'm thrilled to announce that the first 15 bosses are fully set up. Thanks to some custom tools I've built in Unity, managing and expanding data for these bosses has become significantly easier.

### Tackling UI Challenges

One major hurdle I anticipated was the UI design. As the complexity of the game increased, I encountered the challenge of keeping everything visually appealing without cluttering the screen with buttons. After much brainstorming, a strike of inspiration hit—why not treat the UI like an operating system? I added a dock-style toolbar to the bottom of the game screen. This dynamic toolbar houses features like upgrades and a leaderboard, keeping the interface clean while allowing easy access to these crucial elements.

### Introducing the Leaderboard

Speaking of the leaderboard, it's one of the newest features I'm excited about. By utilizing Unity's game services, players can now see a ranking of top hackers. This isn’t just a plain list sorted by hacking power; it's a sophisticated balance that factors in not only the number of bosses defeated but also strategic decisions made throughout gameplay. I aim to ensure no one can dominate the leaderboard with a single playstyle, providing a fair and competitive environment.

### The Balancing Act

Balancing gameplay has been, without a doubt, the most formidable challenge. The crux lies in determining the right mix of resources and upgrades—ensuring players neither progress too rapidly nor too slowly. The balance affects everything from early-game decisions about resources to the benefits of long-term upgrades. It's a continuous trial and error process, with constant adjustments based on my playtesting experiences.

### A Call to Fellow Developers

This balancing act has been enlightening yet tough, and I invite fellow developers to join me in this discussion. I’m keen to learn and exchange ideas about balancing and scaling. Feel free to reach out at [PeterWitham.com/contact](https://peterwitham.com/contact) if you're interested in sharing your insights or if you fancy a chat on this podcast.

### Other Development News

In addition to Project Hack, I’ve been dedicating time to my other projects, like the Endless Hurdles game, and applications like Sub Radar and Job Finder Tracker. The latest update for Sub Radar addressed some cloud syncing and paywall issues, greatly improving its performance.

### Final Thoughts

As we inch towards the end of the year, I plan to delve deeper into my projects and share more regular updates. If you're intrigued by game development or app design, stay tuned and subscribe. I appreciate your support and feedback; they motivate me to keep pushing boundaries and sharing the journey.

I hope this finds you well, wherever you are in your development quest. Until the next time, take care and happy developing!
