Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you thought you’d explained something clearly, only to discover the result wasn’t what you expected? As a software developer, I’ve been there more times than I care to admit. You describe a feature, outline how it should work, and hand it off—only to get something back that doesn’t match your vision.

It’s easy to forget, when you’re the one with the idea, that all the details are in your head. You assume others will fill in the blanks the same way you would, especially if they have a similar background. But that’s rarely the case. The little details you think are obvious often go unspoken, and that’s where misunderstandings creep in.

For example, if I ask someone to add a feature that runs every 24 hours, I might forget to specify exactly how I want it to work. Or if I say I like the color red, I might end up with an interface that’s overwhelmingly red, when I really wanted it as an accent. These are small things, but they add up.

The best advice I can give is to over-explain. Spell out the details, even if they seem obvious. If you don’t, it’s hard to go back and say, “That’s not what I wanted.” You need to communicate the rules, the restrictions, and the expectations—document them, so you have something to reference later.

Sure, it can be frustrating to feel like you have to specify every little thing. But if you don’t, you’re just as responsible for the outcome as the person doing the work. And sometimes, by diving into the details, you might discover a better way to do things—either from your own reflection or from someone else’s perspective.

The more experience you have, the easier it is to forget that not everyone sees things the way you do. So next time you’re working with someone—whether it’s in software, design, or any other field—take the time to over-explain. It might just save you a lot of headaches down the road.
