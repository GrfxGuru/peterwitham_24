This year, for several reasons, mostly around the rising costs of everything from digital to groceries, I decided to reverse my normal pattern and instead of shopping for deals, I’m reducing the amount of subscriptions I pay for.

Which makes me sad in some ways because the services and companies are great, I’m just not getting the return on them through my own actions or in-action.

I’m also starting to dog food more of my own problems as a way to improve my skills and taking advantage of old hardware laying around.

For example, I’m building my own home lab from an old PC using Promox and it’s working great for things that I really just need a local cloud for.

I’ll talk more about that in the future as I learn more and build out what I need. The TL;DR; is I recommend to everyone to try it at least once to either discover what you don’t need to pay for, or appreciate why you pay someone else to take care of it.

I’m also reducing my software subscription licenses as needed, including just reviewing them as the renewals come around, which always seems to be this time of year.
