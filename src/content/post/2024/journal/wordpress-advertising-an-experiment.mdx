In this episode, I wanted to share with you my recent experiment with paying for advertising. As some of you know, I like to try different things to see how they work for me.


So, the story goes like this - I was working on the administration side of my website, which runs on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and uses [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com). While exploring the options, I saw the opportunity to advertise on wordpress.com.

I was intrigued and decided to give it a shot. The process involved selecting a post, setting a budget, and determining the ad campaign duration.


After some calculations, I figured out that for $35, my post could reach a couple of hundred thousand users over seven days. I thought, why not try it since I've been experimenting with different strategies like [Fiverr](https://fiverr.com) recently.

I must admit that I'm not an expert in marketing due to a lack of time and expertise in the field. Despite my limited marketing skills, I decided to invest in this advertising experiment to boost the visibility of my website and podcast.

I selected a podcast episode about developer mental health and burnout for the campaign, hoping to reach my target audience of developers and creators who use WordPress for their projects.

I chose to advertise on WordPress sites specifically because they align well with my target audience and the nature of the content I create. Unlike platforms like Instagram or Facebook, WordPress felt better for reaching developers and tech enthusiasts who engage with longer-form content like blog posts.


The ad campaign is set to run from March 1st to March 7th, and I'm excited to see the results. While $35 might not seem like a considerable investment, it's a step towards increasing awareness about my work rather than directly driving sales.


I'll share updates on the campaign's performance, whether a success or a learning experience. I hope my experience with paid advertising can provide insights for others considering similar strategies or unsure where to invest their marketing efforts.


Stay tuned for more updates on this podcast and my website. I appreciate you joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing more insights in the next episode. Thank you for listening!
