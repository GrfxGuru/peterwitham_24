I get so tired of seeing all the posts from developers claiming they did something in an hour, 4 hours, a day, etc. You get my drift.

I think most of us have seen the posts on social media and agrigated blog sites.

Why they feel compelled to tell the World is beyond me for anything other than self congratulations.

Nobody cares how quickly you did something, they care how well it solves a problem and how well it works.

Just my humble opinion for sure, but I’m saying what I’m sure many other seasoned professionals think. Get over yourselves and go make something amazing taking as long as you need.
