I'm excited to share my recent experiment with [Jetpack](https://www.jetpack.com) and [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.com) advertising.

[Listen / Read the first post here](/2024/journal/wordpress-advertising-an-experiment)

In this post, I'll walk you through my campaign's details and the results I achieved.

Last week, I set up a campaign on WordPress to promote one of the [CompileSwift podcast](https://www.compileswift.com/podcast) episodes discussing developer stresses and struggles. The aim was to direct traffic back to a blog post on PeterWitham.com. Let me explain how it all went.

The campaign ran from March 1st to March 7th on WordPress-hosted blogs. It garnered 36,320 impressions and 88 clicks, resulting in a click-through rate of 0.24%. While the numbers may seem small, I find them quite promising, given the niche target audience.

The increased traffic to my website, particularly to the promoted post, indicates relative success. I'm considering running similar campaigns in the future with adjustments based on the lessons learned from this one.

Overall, I am pleased with this advertising experiment's outcomes and would recommend strategies similar to those of others interested in promoting their content. Feel free to contact me at [PeterWitham.com/contact](/contact) to share your thoughts or even collaborate on discussing marketing strategies.

I hope this post resonates with you and provides some valuable insights. Stay tuned for more updates in the next episode!
