I share a cautionary tale about revisiting and updating old projects with new software. I discuss the pitfalls of using the latest versions of tools on older projects and recount my experience with a game engine and coding tools.

I emphasize the importance of source control and provide updates on my current projects, including a new feature for my Job Finder Tracker app, which is in testing. I also touch on the marketing challenges and my plans for future releases.
