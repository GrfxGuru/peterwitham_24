GameCenter was always a goal I had in mind for my Endless Hurdles game. Now, it is a reality.

Endless Hurdles is my 2D endless runner game on iOS and iPad. The one thing it lacked from the beginning but was always in the plan was a high score system for people to compete against each other.

It is with my beta testers, who are furiously competing for the top spot. I confess satisfaction in watching them battle it out.

One goal I had was to have a system where no one player could dominate the leaderboard. I always find that eventually, on games like that, I stop playing.

So, I have taken the leaderboard toward a weekly reset. The game is simple enough that folks can continue to enjoy and compete without one person dominating. Unless one person obsessively plays the game, which I don't see happening. The data will tell the tale eventually.

Thanks to the easy way to work with leaderboards in GameCenter, this can be achieved with minimal effort via configuration by setting a lifetime time for the board and a reset time.

I will speak more on this in the [Compile Swift](https://compileswift.transistor.fm/) and [UIBuzz](https://uibuzz.transistor.fm/) Podcasts, as I think you will find it interesting if you have ever wanted to use GameCenter.

I hope to release this soon, along with additional changes and features.

You can download the game for free from the [AppStore here](https://peterwitham.com/eh).
