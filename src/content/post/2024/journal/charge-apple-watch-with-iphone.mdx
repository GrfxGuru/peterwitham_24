Today was full of “why did I never think to try this before” moments.

For example, why did I never try charging my Apple Watch using the USB-C port on my iPhone?

There are cables to carry, especially since the watch charging cable is unique and annoying. This way, I just use the charger in my everyday carry kit, and it takes up barely any space in a bag, pocket, or desktop.

Get yourself this simple setup. Here's an Amazon link to the charger I use, which is the same size as the watch.
