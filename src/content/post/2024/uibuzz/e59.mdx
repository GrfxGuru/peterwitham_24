 #### Transcription
  What's up. Everybody. Bill can turn the episode of the UI buzz podcast. And this one, I'm going to talk a little bit about good DOE. And it specifically publishing to Android. And this is more of a question to the audience because I'm a little confused by this and I'm going to go with what I read online and hopefully this will get fixed very soon. But here's the problem. 

I am working on my endless hurdles gain and publishing to the Android platform via Godot. Now I'm using the dove for, for this. And I have not tried reverting back to Godot three to, to know what happens there. So that's number one. I'm assuming it's doable. But I don't know if there's going to be problems with that. 

That would be interesting. And I, if I try that, I'll be sure to share my notes with you on this. But these are the thing is. Publishing with Godot for. And to the Android platform. So basically making an AP K file. Now, not that I understand the full ins and outs of publishing on good dough, but.  I've noticed the performance. 

Firstly, I've successfully published. Right? I created a key store file.   For Android and then got all of that working. Changed a couple of options for the Android export. Just things like adding the icon files and all that kind of standard stuff. Right. So I haven't tweaked any of the advanced settings or anything like that because I don't understand them yet. But I will say this the performance. When I run it on my Android tablet. Is absolutely dreadful. There's no other way to put it. 

It's really terrible. And I, I thought I'd done something wrong, but I went through all the settings and I'm like, Nope, not seeing anything here.  And of course naturally then went online to see what other folks were experiencing and turns out. I found two things and I don't know the relevance of this because some of them are not exactly new posts. 

So if you know better, please reach out to me at @UIBuzz on Twitter. Or go to PeterWitham.com and let me know, but.  There's two things of no, firstly it seems that people are accepting and recognizing that, for some reason. Exporting Godot 4 is really terrible performance compared to Godot three, when it comes to the Android platforms. Now I don't, again, this is a slightly older post, but I don't know, but that, that's why I'm thinking about going backwards. Good at three and, and trying to the export. And the other thing they mentioned and forgive me if I get the name wrong, I'm not that familiar with this. I think it was like GLE three and, and they were saying go and send it to you as GLE. To something like that. 

And people have had good results with that. Now, I don't know if that was with Godot four because they didn't specify. Now, I don't even know what that is, but I'm guessing it's obviously some kind of rendering or engine setting. But when I was looking in the export for Android and the project properties. On Godot. 

I couldn't find this, this option anywhere to try the different settings. So if anyone knows again, anyone knows about that. Reach out to me, let me know.  I'd really want to get this. Uh, testable beta version out for my beta teams to play with on the Android platform. But right now, uh, this performance is so bad that I, I can't even play it myself. 

Let alone. Export it for other people to, to test it.  So I need to get over this now. The good news is I slept plenty of work to do on the game, in the good old version. And I'm working on that. And,  the live streams, I'll put a link in the show notes. And as I've mentioned before,  making a game like this, I'm building a course for it. 

So other folks can go from nothing to a completely game as well, which is also why I wanted to start exploring the export options because I'm getting close to making those videos again. If you're interested in learning that course. There'll be a link in the show notes where you can sign up to be notified when it's ready. 

But  this is a troubling performance issue that I have not seen so far on the other platforms. I published two, for example.  IOS and things like that.  I think I did a Mac version and I may have exported it to windows. I cannot remember. I had, I know I've not tried the web yet. But this is definitely very noticeable on the Android platforms.  If anyone knows anything about this again, I'd be greatly indebted to you if you've got answers or even if you just let me know. 

Yeah. Right now it's a known problem with good old four don't don't go there. Right. Because that's fine. I can do that. I can either wait. But I will likely try it. We could do three.  Don't know, like I say, what happens if you try and load a.  Good old for project in Guthrie, but. I'm certainly willing to try it because time is on my side here. 

I don't have a pressing deadline other than I'd like to get this done. So just putting that out there in. And kind of a short develop of,  audio log version this week. And,  love to hear people's thoughts on this.  Also,  working on a few other things and,  like I said, the Godot course. And basically just learning a lot more about Godot. 

My problem is I'm worried that if the more I learn about the DOE and the less I'm using unreal engine, the more I'll forget about unreal engine, because I have big plans for a 3d game in that as well.  On top of that as well, I've also been working on the Sprite kit version. And putting some updates in there with a unified interface. 

And I'd mentioned before the game center support. Which is,  very interesting,  very close to shipping that I think.  So far not seeing any bugs, as far as that version. So I may ship that version.   Out to the app store on iOS only and see what becomes there, but people seem to be.  Competing with that. 

And the leader board is working. Exactly as I expected. I'll put a link in the show notes for that version of the game. If you want to play it. Other than that folks. That's it just a lot of stuff going on this week. If you would like to come on the podcast and talk about your,  your app or game development, you are more than welcome to again, reach out to me, PeterWitham.com. Or at @UIBuzz  on Twitter or X or whatever, they're calling it this week. That's it folks speak to you. 

The next one.
